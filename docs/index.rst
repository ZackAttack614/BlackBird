BlackBird is a Python implementation of the `AlphaZero
<https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.01815>`_ algorithm. It contains base classes for
running Monte Carlo Tree Search (`MCTS <source/src.html#module-MCTS>`_), `neural
networks <source/src.html#module-Network>`_ running on the `TensorFlow
<https://www.tensorflow.org/>`_ framework, and a template for loading in custom
board games for the system to self-learn.
